## Instructions and Navigations
All of the project files are organized into folders. For example, Chapter03.

The code will look like the following:

```
class Display 
{ 
    public function outputSound() 
    { 
        $dog1 = new Dog(); 

        $dog2 = $dog1; 
        
        $dog1->setSound("Barky Bark"); 

        // Will return "Barky Bark" which was set to $dog1. 

        echo $dog2->returnSound(); 
    } 
}

```

PHP web developers end up building complex enterprise projects without prior experience in test-driven and behavior-driven development which results in software that’s complex and difficult to maintain. This step-by-step guide helps you manage the complexities of large-scale web applications. It takes you through the processes of working on a project, starting from understanding business requirements and translating them into actual maintainable software, to automated deployments.	

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 01-11).
